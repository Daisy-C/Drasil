\chapter{Results}

\section{Originals vs. Reimplementations}
	Link to original case studies and reimplementations
	Highlight key (important) changes with explanations
	Show off major errors/oversights
	Original softifacts LoC vs number of Drasil LoC to reimplement (and compare the output of Drasil - multiple languages, etc.)
\section{“Pervasive” Bugs} 
	- Sounds bad, but actually really good.
 - If a bug shows up in more places, it's more likely to be found.
 - Softifacts remain consistent, even if wrong.
\section{Design for change}
	GlassBR /1000 example
	
\section{Usability}
One of Drasil's biggest issues is that of usability. Unless one reads the source
code or has a member of the Drasil team working with them, it can be incredibly
difficult, or even impossible, to create a new piece of software in Drasil.

As seen in the examples from [SECTION], while the recipe language is fairly
readable, the knowledge-capture mechanisms are arcane and determining which
knowledge has already been added to the database can be very difficult. As our
living knowledge-base expands, this will become even more difficult,
particularly for those concepts with many possible names.

  - As the above mentions, not great, but CS students / summer interns picked it 
    up fast enough to make meaningful changes in a short time period.
